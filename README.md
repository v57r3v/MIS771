MIS771 – Descriptive Analytics and Visualisation – Trimester 2 2024 
Assessment Task 3 – Data Visualisation – Individual
Tasks 
This assessment   has 2   parts. You will   need to create   an Oral Presentation via Video Recording. The   recording   must show you   (the   presenter) visibly   in the video using Tableau’s Storyboard Feature.
To complete the assignment, you must   use the dataset   file   named T32024A3.xlsx   and   apply   the   techniques   covered   in   Module 3.
This data   has   been consolidated from VicRoads, then validated   and enriched   to   provide   a   comprehensive   and   detailed view of   road crashes and   injuries across Victoria.   The   data   provides   users   with   information   about Victorian fatal and   injury   road crash data   basedon time,   location, conditions,   crash   type,   road   user   type,   and   other   relevant attributes. 
The assignment data file   is a single   flat   file   containing   a   subset   of the   attributes   from   multiple   CSV   files.   It   provides a single set of attributes for   each   road   crash   that   has   occurred   within   Victoria.   Supporting documentation   in the   metadata will   provide further details of the attributes.
